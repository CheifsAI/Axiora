The right set of indicators\\n will shine light on performance and highlight areas that need\\n attention. ‘What gets measured gets done’ and ‘if you can’t\\n measure it, you can’t manage it’ are just two of the\\n popular sayings used to highlight the critical importance\\n of metrics. Without the right KPIs managers are sailing blind. \\nThe problem is that most managers are struggling to\\n understand and identify the vital few management metrics\\n and instead collect and report a vast amount of \\neverything that is easy to measure. As a consequence\\n they end up drowning in data while thirsting for\\n information. \\nEffective managers and decision makers understand the\\n performance of all key dimensions of their business by\\n distilling them down into the critical KPIs. Not understanding\\n key metrics can often cause anxiety and can hold people\\n back. This book will demystify and explain in simple terms\\n the most important KPIs in use today. It will equip you with the\\n skills to understand, measure and interpret the most important\\n aspects of any business. \\nHow to use this book \\nYou can use this book in two ways: as an essential\\n reference guide that allows you to look up the KPIs you want\\n to understand and learn more about as and when you need it;\\n or you can use it to help you complete your\\n performance management framework, business dashboard, balanced\\n scorecard or business intelligence strategy.

Most importantly, each measured company\\n or organisation is given a customer satisfaction index score\\n (an ‘ACSI score’) which reflects a weighted average of three\\n satisfaction proxy questions (see next page).

One highprofile firm-level approach is\\n by the consulting firm Interbrand. To do its calculation,\\n Interbrand estimates brand value on the basis of projected\\n profits discounted to a present value. The discount rate is\\n a subjective rate determined by Interbrand and Wall Street\\n equity specialists and reflects the risk profile, market\\n leadership, stability and global reach of the brand. \\nProduct Level: The classic product-level brand measurement\\n example is to compare the price of a no-name or\\n private-label product to an ‘equivalent’ branded product.\\n The difference in price, assuming all things equal, is due\\n to the brand. \\nConsumer Level: This approach aims to map the mind of the\\n consumer to find out what associations with the brand the\\n consumer has. This approach seeks to measure the awareness\\n (recall and recognition) and brand image (the overall associations\\n that the brand has). Free-association tests and projective techniques \\nare commonly used to uncover the tangible and intangible\\n attributes, attitudes, and intentions about a brand. Brands\\n with high levels of awareness and strong, favourable and unique\\n associations are high-equity brands. \\nAll of these calculations are, at best, approximations.
