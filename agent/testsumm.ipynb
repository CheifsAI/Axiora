Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved'), Document(metadata={'source': 'attention.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

      "1. **Regional Sales Concentration**: The majority of sales (77%) come from the Mexico Central region, indicating a strong presence of this region in terms of sales.\n",
      "2. **Sales District Distribution**: The data reveals that Vancouver and Seattle have similar numbers of sales districts, with 10 and 9 sales districts respectively. This suggests a concentrated presence of these cities in terms of sales.\n",
      "3. **Sales Region Correlation**: There is a strong correlation between the region ID and the sales region name, indicating that the regions are well-defined and consistent.\n",
      "4. **Regional Sales Variance**: The sales data for different regions show varying levels of sales, with some regions having much higher sales than others. This could indicate regional differences in market demand or sales strategies.\n",
      "5. **Cities within Regions**: Within the Mexico Central region, Mexico City has a high number of sales districts (6), suggesting that this city is an important hub for sales.\n",

      "1. **Focus on Key Regions**: The company should focus on strengthening its presence in the Mexico Central region, particularly in Mexico City.\n",
      "2. **Targeted Sales Strategies**: The sales teams in Vancouver and Seattle could benefit from targeted strategies to increase their sales performance.\n",
      "3. **Regional Analysis**: Further analysis of regional sales data could help identify areas for improvement and opportunities for growth.\n",
